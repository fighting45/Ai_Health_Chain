# 🏥 Healthcare Management System — Backend API

## 📘 Overview

This backend simulates a **healthcare management system MVP**.

There is **no authentication**, and all data is stored **in-memory** (no database required).
The goal is to allow candidates to focus on building frontend functionality while interacting with a realistic REST API.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js 18+**
- **Express.js 4**
- In-memory mock data (no DB)
- Modular routing (`/routes`)
- Ready for local development & integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the backend server

```bash
npm start
```

The API server starts by default on **http://localhost:3000**

If you also run the React frontend (from `/frontend`), it will automatically proxy requests to this backend.

## 🧠 Data Model Overview

All data is stored in-memory. There are **three primary entities**:

| Entity           | Description                                      | Example Fields                                      |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Patients**     | Basic patient demographics and medical history.  | `id`, `name`, `age`, `gender`, `medicalHistory`     |
| **Doctors**      | Providers with specialties and bios.             | `id`, `name`, `specialty`, `bio`                    |
| **Appointments** | Links patients with doctors and scheduled times. | `id`, `patientId`, `doctorId`, `dateTime`, `reason` |

> Note: Since data is not persisted, any changes (POST/PUT/DELETE) are temporary and reset on server restart.
